# JavaScript Simon Game
#### "Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. -- Wikipedia"

This Simon JS project recreates the famouse game, but with unique sounds for each button (sounds downloaded for free from **Pixabay.com**).  
- This project uses 100% **Vanilla JavaScript** (NO jquery)
- Uses **keydown** event to start game (any key press with do)
- **serveBtn()** function pics a random button and flashes it with the sound. 
- random button **sequence** is stored in an array
- User tries to follow along by clicking the sequence after each new button is added. 
- Button click function checks if button clicked by user matches corresponding color in the **sequence** array.
- There is a **START** file with instructions / comments (but no code), if you would like to try to write the code by following the comments.
- For a more ambitious challenge, delete all the comments / hints and code all from scratch.

// ALGORITHM..?
// grab all 4 buttons in the simon-container 
// get em into an array of 4 elements (Node List)


 // a boolean to keep track of wheter game is in play
 // an array to store sequence of randomly serve buttons
// keep track of user button clicks to compare to sequence index
// get the h2 for providing feedback

// make each button clickable, on click log id of the button, which is the color


// GAME ON! Press any key to start game:
// One of the 4 buttons flash.. this is user's cue to click the same button.

// document listen for key === any key -- and runs make button flash when
// any key is clicked -- flash consists of .5 sec delay before ran btn vanishes
// then another .5 sec later, button reappears (opacity -- not display none)


// Start game by hitting any key once:
// that generates a rand button BUT for next ran btn, user does NOT hit key
// all subsequent rand btns happen automatically

   
 // 0-3

// 1.0 sec delay then rand btn vanishes
        
// console.log(`Key: ${event.key}<br>Code: ${event.code}`);
// console.log('random button',btn.id); //button
// 1.5 sec delay then rand btn vanishes

// 0.6 sec later, button reappears

// save the color of the served btn to the btnSw arr
